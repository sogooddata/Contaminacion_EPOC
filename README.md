# Contaminacion_EPOC
During the las decades, the interest for respiratory diseases and its relation to our lifestyles is growing exponentially. While several studies already point out a clear correlation between these kind of diseases and other indicators as pollution or traffic, it is not yet clear how this relation is modelled or how we might use data for the sake of improving public health. Consequentially, we propose to explore this intriguing but enormously important field from the data science perspective. 

Reseach topics and areas of interest:

- Data analysis of the spatio-temporal diseases series.

- Correlation studies between respiratory diseases and pollution (or any other indicator).

- Hospital admission forecasting.

- Hospital readmissions estimation.

 We are always open to new perspectives, so any other idea that tries to understand respiratory diseases better is welcome.
